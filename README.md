Hi folks, it ain't that important to who I am--all you need to know is I like to code and eat :>.

- As of the moment I am working on project-green-cross (Electronic Medical Record System)
- I'm currently learning Flask framework and the web overall, and hopefully by the end of the year I get to atleast finish 3 systems (including our capstone)
- My pronouns are hee/hee just like how Michael Jackson says it
- Fun fact about me is...can't think of anything hehe, if we vibe--we vibe.

Here have a hotdog <br>
