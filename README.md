## Supsup üëã
Hi folks, it ain't that important to know who I am--all you need to know is I like to code and eat :>.

- As of the moment I am working on project-green-cross (Electronic Medical Record System)
- I'm currently learning Flask framework and the web overall, and hopefully by the end of the year I get to atleast finish 3 systems (including our capstone)--and the next ones are still not planned nor pretty much thinking about it
- My pronouns are hee/hee just like how Michael Jackson says it
- Fun fact about me is...can't think of anything hehe, if we vibe--we vibe.

## Programming related dream projects (minimal library and no framework ﬁè‚Çç ·Ω∏.œå‚ÇéﬁÉ)
- Video Games (possible genres would be, survival-horror, jrpg, stealth, and many more)
- Web browser
- Anti-Virus
- Artificial Intelligence
- Some health related tool (its for the people ~(Àò‚ñæÀò~) ~(Àò‚ñæÀò)~ (~Àò‚ñæÀò)~)

## Not so programming related dream projects but with included programming (some discoveries or innovation)
- ROBOOOOOOOOOT Ôºº(ÔΩÄ0¬¥)Ôºè
- build some businesses (im gonna need funds ¬Ø\_‡≤†_‡≤†_/¬Ø)
